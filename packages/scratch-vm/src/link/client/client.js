/**
 * Abstract base for a device-link backend: the single contract for discovering, opening, building
 * for, flashing, and monitoring one physical device. Two backends implement it — the native helper
 * over a WebSocket ({@link LinkClient}) and the browser's Web Serial API (web mode) — so the firmware
 * pipeline and the GUI can drive either without knowing which transport is behind it.
 *
 * Concrete clients extend this and implement every method below; the base throws to surface a
 * half-implemented backend the moment it is used. A client owns its transport (a helper WS session, a
 * serial port handle); the flasher and the serial monitor borrow it rather than opening their own.
 *
 * Wire formats never escape a client. Each backend maps its transport's shapes onto the VM-facing
 * typedefs defined here ({@link ConnectionTarget}, {@link Artifact}), so callers stay transport-agnostic.
 *
 * Implementations emit `Runtime.DEVICE_CONNECTED` / `Runtime.DEVICE_DISCONNECTED` so the GUI and the
 * serial monitor can track the link.
